Summary: 

All i have is one more exam! One more exam and no more for ever! But studying for a half-Perl exam is so excruciatingly painful and confusing when the other half of the exam is Python, the ugliness versus the neatness.<br \/><br \/>Explicit versus implicit.<br \/><br \/>I always claim that if a programming\/scripting language wasn't designed as a Object Oriented language then adding the OO functionality later doesn't work. For example Tcl. Or even Perl. We were told to that you can class using perl modules and some weird ass perl references to modules. It doesn't work because syntactically the language wasn't designed to be OO. It just doesn't feel right, it's my personal view.<br \/><br \/>Get back to some Python and Zope goodness (don't get me started on frameworks!)
