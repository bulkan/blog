Summary:


The Faber-Castell Ambition Pearwood is it not my first fountain pen but it is one
of the expensive ones that I&#39;ve bough recently. It&#39;s been in my daily usage and at the moment it is
inked with Iroshizuku Yama-guri. When I first bought it I had it inked with Diamine Oxblood as
I like to colour match the body of the fountain pen with the ink.

The pearwood has a medium nib and it writes really smoothly. The nib is a bit more on the thicker side
of line variation compared to other nibs but this also provides a really nice shading.

Here is an album of images. The notebook I used for the writing sample is the Monsiuer Fountain Pen friendly notebook.
I find it hard to believe this notebook is marketed as such as with certain nibs & ink  the feathering and ghosting is really noticeable.
