Summary: 

I have plans to move to using a Django blog that i can customize myself. I don't know if i should go down the route of implementing my own or using one that exist. <a href="http://blog.michaeltrier.com/2007/12/30/django-blogging-apps">Here</a> is a list of Blogging applications written in Django. What i need is something<br /><br /><ul><li>easily <i>skinable</i> allowing me to change the look-and-feel to the way i want it, something green and minimalistic</li><li>someway of transferring all the posts here to that app</li><li>Tagging</li><li>Allowing comments on posts<br /></li></ul>Seems like <a href="http://coderseye.com/2007/banjo-blog-nearing-01-release.html">Banjo</a> has all the things i want.<br /><br />Maybe <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blogmaker">Blogmaker</a> aswell. Even though Byteflow has Threaded comments it restricts comments to only registered users which i don't want.<br /><br />And i may look into <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-diario/">django-diario</a><br /><br />But i will just play with Banjo now.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">EDIT: </span>To play with Django i need to install 5 other packages. I'm adding a new requirement to the blog application i need, easily configurable, download change <span style="font-style: italic;">settings.py </span>with correct paths, create database, run <span style="font-style: italic;">syncdb</span> and start server (built in server), start Blogging. I don't want to go hunting for more packages.<br />
