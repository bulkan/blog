Summary: 

Here is URL for a search on seek.com.au for Analyst/Programmer in Melbourne.<br /><br />removed<br />Top three development positions are as of today (Tuesday 15th) are

    * Senior Java - J2EE Developers
    * Senior Analyst Programmer - .NET
    * PHP Web Developer

So the question is why doesn't universities, well RMIT,  change its teaching style. Instead of starting off with Java for two semesters, introduction then advanced topics like Linked Lists etc. Then second year two semesters of C, again basics, pointers and then next semester with advanced topics, Splay Trees, Red-Black trees.<br /><br />Any PHP developers out there implement a Splay Tree for a web app? No?<br />Any Firmware/Embedded programmers out there implement a Patricia Trie? Yes?<br /><br />Look at the results again, i don't see any Embedded programmer....<br /><br />Follow the industry trends, i understand that change is a bit hard it takes long, so much beurocracy, blah blah
blah. We all graduate and don't have the knowledge the industry wants. Software Engineering undergrads are even more disadvantaged, we have only four (?) electives. So what can i choose? .NET ?
