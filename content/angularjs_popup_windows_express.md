## Introduction

Popup windows are extremely annoying hence most modern browsers block them, agreeably so. 
That being said one use of popup windows is when doing OAuth. Showing the OAuth authorization dialog in a 
popup window as not to confuse the user.

In this blog post I will hopefully demonstrate my solution using express/passportjs to authenticate with GitHub.
If there is a better or different way please comment below.


## Backend


* write a simple express app using passport.js to oauth againts GitHub

## Frontend

* Use cdnjs to load files

* / renders nothing
