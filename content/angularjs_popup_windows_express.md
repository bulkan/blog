Summary:

## Introduction

Popup windows are extremely annoying hence most modern browsers block them, agreeably so. 
That being said one use of popup windows is when doing OAuth. Showing the OAuth authorization dialog in a 
popup window as not to confuse the user.

In this blog post I will hopefully demonstrate my solution using a simple express 4 app and a little AngularJS.

If there is a better or different way please comment below.

All the code can be found at [angular-popup](https://github.com/bulkan/angular-popup).

## Frontend

* Use cdnjs to load files

* / renders nothing
