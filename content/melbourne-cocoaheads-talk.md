Summary: 


I had volunteered long time ago to give a talk at <a href="http://www.melbournecocoaheads.com/melbourne-cocoaheads-april-meeting/">Melbourne CocoaHeads</a> as i was talking to Gareth about when the next meeting was going to happen he told me that someone (<a href="http://redartisan.com/">Marcus Crafter</a>) was going to give a talk on RubyCocoa, so jokingly i suggested, well i can do a talk on PyObjC (even though my knowledge is near zero) then it became serious and i said i can give a talk on py2app. So im giving a talk on py2app. <br /><br />I should start creating my slides and organizing my code.
