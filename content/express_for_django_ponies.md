Summary:


Express is the most popular _web_ framework in Node.js and It can be used in a way that can be very similar to Django. Hopefully in this article I will show you how to do this.

If you have not installed `Node.js` go ahead and get it from [here](http://nodejs.org/download/). Once installed quickly test your installion via these commands.

`node --version` and `npm --version`

You should see version numbers for `node` & `npm`.

Install `express` using the following command.

`npm install express`

Remember `virtualenv` in Python to keep package versions seperate.
